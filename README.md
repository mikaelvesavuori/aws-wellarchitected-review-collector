# AWS Well-Architected Tool Review Collector

This solution sets up a small service that collects the high-level AWS Well-Architected review data for a given workload. It's currently for a single account, so you'd either need to modify this, or deploy this utility to each account you want to collect reviews from.

It's a convenient solution if you want, for example, to display the number of risks for a workload in your own dashboards or systems monitoring tool.

You could easily extend this solution with additional functionality; see [the AWS docs on the WA tool](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSJavaScriptSDK/v3/latest/clients/client-wellarchitected/index.html) for what is possible.

## Prerequisites

- Recent [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) (ideally 18+) installed.
- Amazon Web Services (AWS) account with sufficient permissions so that you can deploy infrastructure. A naive but simple policy would be full rights for CloudWatch, Lambda, API Gateway, DynamoDB, X-Ray, and S3.
- Ideally some experience with [Serverless Framework](https://www.serverless.com) as that's what we will use to deploy the service and infrastructure.
- You will need to set up a workload in the AWS Well-Architected Tool manually, as that's not part of this solution.

## Installation

Clone, fork, or download the repo as you normally would. Run `npm install`.

## Commands

The below commands are the most critical ones. See `package.json` for more commands! Substitute `npm` for `yarn` or whatever floats your boat.

- `npm start`: Run Serverless Framework in offline mode
- `npm run deploy`: Deploy with Serverless Framework
- `npm run build`: Package and build the code with Serverless Framework
- `npm run teardown`: Removes the deployed stack

## Configuration

You need to set your AWS account number. Do this either by passing it in via CLI, e.g. `npx sls deploy --account 123412341234` or setting the fallback value in `serverless.yml`:

```yml
awsAccountNumber: ${opt:account, '123412341234'}
```

## API examples

### Request

The request requires the workload ID to be passed in.

Note that you might need to switch on the ID column if using the web console/UI as it's not visible by default.

```bash
curl https://RANDOM.execute-api.REGION.amazonaws.com/reviews?id=WORKLOAD_ID
```
